# Game Plan
## Game Title: Bakeout - Eric Jiang (edj9)


### Breakout Variant
Super Breakout: In addition to the standard power ups (detailed below), special power ups allow the user to shoot multiple balls and lasers. I find this variant particularly interesting because it illuminates the usefulness of code modularity; I can reuse a bouncer class to create any number of new balls. 

### General Level Descriptions
There will be at least 3 levels with increasing difficulty. The first level will feature the lowest ball speed and the weakest blocks. The second level will feature intermediate ball speed and stronger blocks. The third level will feature the fastest ball speed and strongest blocks. Power ups become more abundant as the level difficulty increases.

### Bricks Ideas
The bricks will range in strength, requiring between 1 and 3 hits to destroy. They will be colored differently such that the user knows how many hits are remaining. Some bricks which take 1 hit to destroy give power ups.

### Power Up Ideas
* Widen paddle
* Slow down ball
* Multiple balls
* Shoot lasers from paddle

### Cheat Key Ideas
* 'L' will give the player one additional life
* '1-3' will change to scene to the corresponding level
* 'S' will slow down the ball

### Something Extra
There will be two paddles, with one located directly above the other. Both will serve the same function, essentially giving the user two chances to hit the ball.
